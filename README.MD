# Bazitadebiyicomet Project

This repository contains a simple Flask web service and supporting Terraform infrastructure.
It also includes GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing and deploying the application.

## Project Structure

- `hello-basit-comet/` – Flask application with Dockerfile and tests
- `infrastructure/` – Terraform code for AWS resources (EKS, VPC, IAM, etc.)
- `.github/workflows/` – CI/CD pipelines for Docker builds and Terraform

## Build Instructions

1. Install Python 3.11 and Docker
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd hello-basit-comet
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run tests locally:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. pytest -v
   ```
4. Build the container image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t hello-basit-comet:latest hello-basit-comet
   ```

## CI/CD Overview

The project uses GitHub Actions with three workflows:

- **build_and_push.yaml** – tests the Python app, builds a Docker image and pushes it to AWS ECR
- **tf_plan.yaml** – runs `terraform plan` on pull requests and posts the result to the PR
- **tf_apply.yaml** – after merging to `main`, runs a plan and waits for manual approval to apply

These workflows automate testing and infrastructure provisioning.
